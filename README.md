# Detecting Mental health behaviours using Mobile Interactions (DeMMI)

This repo is a fork of the [Aware Client](https://github.com/denzilferreira/aware-client) used in the DeMMI project to collect interaction data from people with and without self-harm and binge eating behaviours. It adds the following functionality:

- Local (smartphone) encryption with a random password using SQLCipher 4.2.0
- Mood self-reporting functionality using a 5-point face scale
- Self-harm and binge eating episode self-reporting using a single button
